{"name":"EEG","tagline":"English Engine for Grammar","body":"## English Engine Grammar.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms used for this system are based upon the Direct Context Grammar architecture of SWI-Prolog, which uses a modified \"if-then\" operator: (X-->Y) which is equivalent to a strict equality.\r\n\r\nThe principle development of this was funded by NASA, and the research was conducted at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  The work was presented at the annual Augustana Symposium in 2010 by Ian Malloy, and can be found on youtube.com at the link labeled \"symposium\" at the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\nTo test the code, the following images depict both the call structure and subsequent \"up\" function.  For the display of algorithms, enter \"L\" for \"list.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n![List of Call Structure](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11950997/73b748d6-a885-11e5-8b64-0fe2b728df68.png)\r\n\r\nThe call structure shows the full relationship between algorithms of interest.\r\n\r\n![Stream Input for Three Sentences.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11950998/73dcc4bc-a885-11e5-95d4-4a1931ee5d2a.png)\r\n\r\nThe streaming of input returns an error after the third entry, requiring an operator at the end of the call in place of a full stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Produce Phrases](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11951005/7879da96-a885-11e5-9d72-2148d1f7aed3.png)\r\n\r\nThe final image illustrates how to produce the grammatical structures, which have an initially goodness-of-fit to English (American) of 83%.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Author\r\nInitially developed in 2010, Ian Malloy (@FunctionAnalysis).\r\n\r\n[Symposium Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLHowkYog28)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
